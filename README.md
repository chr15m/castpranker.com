This is a web app for pranking your family using chromecast.
It's a basic contentEditable page you can write in and paste images, and then cast to the TV while your family is watching.
I built this in a 3.5 hour live-stream you can watch here: https://youtu.be/KWBljrPdQc4

Deployed with [Piku](https://github.com/piku/piku).
